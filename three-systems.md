The three views of my knowledge graph.

1. A time-oriented event log. Fast to write, fast to read. Time-oriented. I can see the most recently added nodes, and add notes without having to match a certain schema. Roam research does a great job at this.
2. A more structured, curated wiki. This is designed for faster reference and better search. I can take parts of my zettlekasten and put them in markdown documents that are easy to reference later. For example, everything I've written about [[clojure]] and [[python]] should live here. This view is currently out of reach right now for me, without duplicating the time-oriented event log.
3. Cards for spaced repetition. I can do this from Roam already, using the spaced repetition feature of the Roam Toolkit.
